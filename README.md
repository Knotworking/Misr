See how much money your time is worth, and how much time your money is worth.

A colleague of mine was interested in having an app which showed a money-counting clock to illustrate in real time how much various activities cost.

**Known Issue:** If your device is set to a German locale (and probably others), the app crashes due to the 'decimal point' being a 'decimal comma'.
